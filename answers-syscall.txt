Q. Which registers contain arguments to functions? For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to printf?
A. a0 ~ a7; a2 stores the value of 13

Q. Where is the function call to f from main? Where is the call to g? (Hint: the compiler may inline functions.)
A. Both f and g are inline functions. In main, the compiler directly calculates the value of f(8) + 1 = 12, so it stores the value of 12 to a1;
 The call to g in f is also transformed into ``addiw  a0, a0, 3``

Q. At what address is the function printf located?
A. critical instruction: 
   auipc	ra,0x0  
   jalr rd ra 0x620; jalr x0 ra 0x620
   so printf is at pc + 0x620

Q. What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main?
A. ra = pc + 0x0 = pc
